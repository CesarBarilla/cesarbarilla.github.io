<img src="/images/Barilla_2.jpg" alt="drawing" width="300" height="300" style="float: left; padding-right:20px"/> I am a third year PhD Student in Economics at Columbia University, New York. 

I am interested in economic theory broadly speaking. I also have work in Mathematics on optimal transport and mean field games.

I previously studied at Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS Ulm), Paris School of Economics, and Sorbonne University (UPMC-Jussieu) in Paris.

You can find [a list of relevant research work here](https://cesarbarilla.github.io/research/) and a short [CV here](https://cesarbarilla.github.io/cv/) (or [downlad my detailed CV](https://cesarbarilla.github.io/files/CV_Barilla_2020_detailed.pdf)).
