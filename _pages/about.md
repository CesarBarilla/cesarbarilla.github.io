I'm a second year PhD Student in Economics at Columbia University, New York. I'm interested in (among many things) economic theory, mathematical economics, modeling, dynamic games, matching, search theory, labour economics. I also have work in Mathematics, centered around optimal transport and mean field games.

Previously, I studied at Ecole Normale Superieure (ENS Ulm) in Paris. I obtained a M.A. in Economics from Paris School of Economics (Master APE) and a M.Sc. in Mathematics from Sorbonne University (UPMC-Jussieu).
